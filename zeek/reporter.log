1716369321.959469	Reporter::WARNING	Your interface is likely receiving invalid TCP checksums, most likely from NIC checksum offloading.  By default, packets with invalid checksums are discarded by Zeek unless using the -C command-line option or toggling the 'ignore_checksums' variable.  Alternatively, disable checksum offloading by the network adapter to ensure Zeek analyzes the actual checksums that are transmitted.	/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/misc/find-checksum-offloading.zeek, line 54
